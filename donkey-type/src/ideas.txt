ideas: 
header options: 
    types of things to type: 
        random common code words: (if, then, for, const, var, return, etc)
        common code snippets: (for loop, while loop, do while loop, etc)
        algorithims: (bubble sort, insertion sort, etc)
    test modes
        zen (go until you get bored)
        timed (15s, 30s, 1 min)
        by character count (idk what a good amount is but we can figure it out)

    future enhacement vibes
        picking which language


make our own library of algorithims, code snippets, code words
